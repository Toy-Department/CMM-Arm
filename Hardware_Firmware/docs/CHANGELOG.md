## [1.0.2] - 2025-11-20

### 🐛 Fixed
- **CRITICAL FIX**: X coordinate not zeroing properly when using ZERO command
  - Added `xOffset`, `yOffset`, `zOffset` variables in main sketch
  - Modified `kinematics.cpp` to subtract offsets from calculated position
  - Now `ZERO` command correctly sets current position as origin (0,0,0)
- Improved command parameter parsing with extra whitespace trimming
- Added debug output for parameter parsing diagnostics

### 📝 Changed
- Updated firmware version identifier to 1.0.2
- Updated firmware date to 2025-11-20
- Enhanced code comments in `kinematics.cpp` explaining offset system

### 📚 Documentation
- Created comprehensive GitHub documentation suite
- Added README.md with complete feature overview
- Added HARDWARE_SETUP.md with detailed BOM and wiring
- Added QUICK_START.md for 15-minute setup
- Added CHANGELOG.md (this file) for version tracking

## [1.0.1] - 2025-11-18

### ✨ Added
- Tool offset support via `SETTOOL` command
- Runtime dimension configuration via `SETDIM` command
- Runtime encoder resolution change via `SETPPR` command
- Enhanced error handling for invalid parameters
- Version command (`VERSION`) returns firmware version and date

### 🐛 Fixed
- Serial buffer overflow protection
- Command parsing improved to handle various input formats
- Float parsing for Arduino (replaced sscanf with atof/strtok)

### 📝 Changed
- Improved serial protocol documentation in header comments
- Enhanced error messages for better user feedback
- Optimized kinematics calculation performance
